# umbau is an experiment into wonder    

We are a guerrilla studio and radical design school working to re-define architecture and learning. We have been operating studios in Vienna, Austria, Kraków, Poland, and in the United States for over twenty years. We are discovering ways into the miraculous.

# healing architecture + education
        
We see a need for improvement in both our living spaces and our systems of education. We believe that spaces are an inherent part of how we experience the world and significantly impact our wellbeing. Our current modes of thinking have forced many into living spaces that do not address our ecological impact nor give us the quality of life we desire.  

We are at a pivotal moment in history and have the opportunity to respond and repair, but we require a new mind.

# about

Umbau is to re-define the role of the architect, even the name. We will leave ‘architect’, and instead, breed **LANDERS**.   

Umbau, a guerrilla studio and radical architecture and design school, is experimenting with other ways of doing. We are an unconventional school for unconventional times. Our emphasis is to breed a new way of thinking: one that savors uncertainty, thrives on disruption, and transforms educational systems.   

Umbau as a school operates at different speeds and rhythms, both long and short. We investigate a range of disciplines through the creative process. Umbau survives on collaboration.

<div class="deco"></div>

William Tate founded umbau in 2001 as an educational non-profit and guerilla studio. Through umbau he has led the studios in Vienna and Kraków. As professor of architectural design at James Madison University, Tate has honed his teaching of studio and history. Moments of transformation have included Wake Forest, Virginia Tech, working with Ricardo Legorreta, meeting Luis Barragán, visiting monasteries, every moment in Vienna and Kraków, and the wonder of family. Umbau is an outlet to spread the contagion for the Good.
